"""Schema-drift canary for Decodo SERP responses.

Decodo's parsed schema can shift without warning — a renamed field can silently
become `None` everywhere. `validate_response` asserts the fields we depend on
are present and returns a list of issues. The fetcher logs these but does not
raise on a single drift event; the runner can escalate after consecutive failures.
